<h2> The Project includes: </h2> <br> 
 - Research of the data set <br> 
 - Code in Python with investigations - analysys.py<br> 
• outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file, <br> 
• saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and <br> 
• outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables. <br>

<b> History of The Dataset </b> <br>
The Iris flower dataset is also known as the Fisher’s Iris dataset. Your guess is right — this is the same Fisher, Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, who also invented the Fisher’s exact test. As a Fellow of the Royal Society, Sir Fisher was born in 1890 in London, England, and was well-known as a statistician and geneticist.
In 1936, Fisher published a report titled “The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems” in the journal Annals of Eugenics. In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. It was the first time that the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species as mentioned above appeared publicly. 

<b> Dataset</b> <br>
The three Iris species in the dataset: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor,  records the lengths and widths of sepals and petals for these flowers.
